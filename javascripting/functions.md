# Functions

A function is a block of code that takes input, processes that input, and  
  then produces output.  
  
  create a file functions.js
  
  ```sh
  touch functions.js
  ```
  
 define a function named eat that takes an argument named  
food that is expected to be a string.  

function eat (food) {
};

inside the function return food argument:
```sh
return food + ' tasted really good.';  
```
my code:
```sh
function eat (food) {
  return food + ' tasted really good.';  
}
```

Add a console.log() and call the eat() function with  
  the string bananas as the argument.  
```sh
console.log(eat('bananas'));
```
